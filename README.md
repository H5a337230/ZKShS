Implemented filters are in 8 main categories:
1) SCADA

6) MODEM/ROUTER
7) DATABASE
8) OTHER

Also, You can use some dynamic filters(city, country, port, os, geo, ip/netmask, hostname, dateab) alongside these filters and for more flexibility you can use your own custom query and combine all 3 filters type(implementerd filters, dynamic filters and your own custom query).
